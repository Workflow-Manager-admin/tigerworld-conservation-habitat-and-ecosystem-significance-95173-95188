              Tigers (<em>Panthera tigris</em>) are one of the most iconic and recognizable big cats in the world. 
              Known for their distinctive orange coat with black stripes, powerful build, and solitary nature, 
              tigers have captivated human imagination for centuries.
            </p>
            <p>
              As apex predators, tigers play a critical role in maintaining the health and balance of the 
              ecosystems they inhabit. However, their populations have faced dramatic declines due to habitat 
              loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict.
            </p>
            <p>
              The tiger is the largest extant cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. Its most recognizable feature is a pattern of dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat to support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cubs stay with their mother for about two years, then become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own. The tiger once ranged widely from Eastern Anatolia and the Caucasus to Central, East and South Asia, but has been extirpated in some parts of this range and now inhabits just 7% of its historical territory.

          <div className="tiger-text-content">
            <h3>Historical Range</h3>
            <p>
              Tigers once roamed across vast swaths of Asia, from Eastern Turkey and the Caucasus mountains through most of South and Southeast Asia to parts of Siberia and the Korean Peninsula. Their historical range covered over 21 countries and spanned multiple climate zones, from tropical forests to temperate woodlands and taiga.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Current Range</h3>
            <p>
              Today, tigers occupy just 7% of their historical range. They have been extirpated from approximately 93% of their former habitat and are now restricted to isolated populations across 13 countries: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Russia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
            </p>
            <p>
              The largest remaining populations are found in India, which is home to approximately 70% of the world's wild tigers. Other significant populations exist in Russia, Indonesia, and Nepal.

            In just the past century, tigers have lost more than 95% of their historical range. The most dramatic losses occurred in Central and Western Asia, where entire tiger subspecies (such as the Caspian tiger) have disappeared completely. Ongoing habitat fragmentation continues to isolate remaining populations, making genetic exchange increasingly difficult.

        <div className="tiger-content">
          <div className="tiger-text-content">
            <h3>Hunting Techniques</h3>
            <p>
              Tigers are ambush predators who rely on stealth and strength rather than speed or endurance. They stalk their prey, using vegetation as cover, before launching a powerful attack designed to quickly bring down their target. With their excellent night vision, sensitive hearing, and camouflaged coats, they can approach within 20 meters of prey without being detected.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Diet and Feeding Habits</h3>
            <p>
              As obligate carnivores, tigers feed exclusively on meat. Their preferred prey consists of large ungulates such as sambar deer, wild boar, and water buffalo, though they will also hunt smaller animals when necessary. An adult tiger can consume up to 40 kg (88 lb) of meat in a single meal and may not need to hunt again for several days.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tigers typically make a kill once every 8-10 days and drag the carcass to a secluded area to feed over several days. They start feeding at the hindquarters, and will often cover their kill with leaves and soil to hide it from scavengers when not feeding.
            </p>

            <h3>Social Structure</h3>
            <p>
              Unlike lions, tigers are primarily solitary animals. Adult males and females only come together briefly to mate, after which the male plays no role in raising cubs. A mother will care for her cubs for about 2-3 years before they become independent.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tigers are highly territorial, with adult males holding territories that may overlap with those of several females but exclude other males. They mark their territories with urine, feces, and by scratching marks on trees. A male's territory can cover 60-100 kmÂ² (23-39 sq mi), while female territories are smaller, typically 20-40 kmÂ² (8-15 sq mi).

        <h2>Reproduction and Lifespan</h2>
        <div className="tiger-stripe-divider"></div>
        <div className="tiger-content">
          <div className="tiger-text-content">
            <h3>Mating and Reproduction</h3>
            <p>
              Tigers have no fixed breeding season and can mate year-round, though births tend to be more common in certain months depending on the region. A female tiger is receptive for 3-7 days within a 21-day cycle and advertises her readiness to mate through vocalizations and scent markings.
            </p>
            <p>
              After mating, the gestation period is about 103-105 days. A female typically gives birth to 2-4 cubs in a secluded den, often in a cave, among dense vegetation, or in a hollow tree. The cubs are born blind and helpless, weighing just 780-1,600 g (1.7-3.5 lb).
            </p>
            
            <h3>Cub Development</h3>
            <p>
              Tiger cubs open their eyes at 6-14 days old and begin to take solid food at 8 weeks, though they continue to nurse for 5-6 months. They start accompanying their mother on hunts at about 6 months and begin to participate in hunting at about 11 months. The mother teaches them essential hunting skills through observation and practice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mortality is high among tiger cubs, with approximately 50% dying before they reach independence. The main causes of death include starvation, accidents, abandonment by the mother, and infanticide by adult males.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Lifespan</h3>
            <p>
              In the wild, tigers typically live 10-15 years, though some individuals have been known to live up to 20 years. In captivity, where they receive regular food and veterinary care, tigers can live 16-20 years on average, with some reaching 25 years or more.
            </p>
            <p>
              The primary causes of natural mortality among adult tigers include injuries sustained during hunting or territorial disputes, diseases, and starvation due to loss of teeth or physical capabilities with age.

            <h3>Ancient Symbolism</h3>
            <p>
              For thousands of years, tigers have featured prominently in the art, literature, mythology, and folklore of many Asian cultures. In Chinese culture, the tiger is one of the 12 animals of the zodiac and symbolizes power, courage, and protection. It is considered the king of all beasts and a symbol of the god of wealth.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Hindu mythology, the goddess Durga rides a tiger as her mount, symbolizing her power and control over wild nature. The tiger is also associated with Shiva, one of the principal deities of Hinduism.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Tigers in Modern Culture</h3>
            <p>
              Tigers continue to hold a prominent place in contemporary culture. They are popular mascots for sports teams, feature in numerous children's books and films, and serve as national animals for several countries including India, Malaysia, and South Korea.
            </p>
            <p>
              The tiger's distinctive appearance and reputation for strength and beauty have made it an enduring symbol in global marketing and branding, from breakfast cereals to gasoline companies.

          <h4>Famous Tigers</h4>
          <p>
            Throughout history, certain individual tigers have gained fame or notoriety. The "Champawat Tiger" was a female Bengal tiger responsible for an estimated 436 deaths in Nepal and India before being shot in 1907. In literature, Shere Khan from Rudyard Kipling's "The Jungle Book" remains one of the most famous fictional tigers. In the realm of conservation, "Machli" (T-16) was perhaps the world's most photographed tiger, living in Ranthambore National Park in India until her death in 2016 at the age of 20.

              Tigers once roamed across vast swaths of Asia, from Turkey in the west to eastern Russia and 
              from Siberia in the north to the Indonesian islands in the south. Today, their range has been 
              reduced by about 93%, confining them to fragmented pockets of habitat.

            <h3>Tigers as Ecosystem Engineers</h3>
            <p>
              As apex predators, tigers help regulate prey populations, which in turn influences vegetation 
              patterns and overall ecosystem health. Their presence indicates a healthy, functioning ecosystem 
              with intact food webs.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Umbrella Effect</h3>
            <p>
              Protecting tigers and their habitats indirectly protects countless other species that share 
              the same ecosystems. A single tiger reserve may be home to thousands of plant and animal species.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Economic Value</h3>
            <p>
              Tiger conservation can drive economic benefits through ecotourism, providing sustainable 
              livelihoods for local communities while preserving natural resources.
            </p>

            <h3>Cultural Significance</h3>
            <p>
              Tigers hold immense cultural value across Asia, appearing prominently in art, literature, 
              mythology, and national identities. This cultural connection can be leveraged to promote 
              conservation efforts.
